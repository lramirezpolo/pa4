# Question 11a: Results


- Our model examines center of gravity (COG) -dependent variable- as a function of skewness -independent variable- for the [s] segments. COG is a measure of the central tendency of a distribution, while skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution. The intercept is at 8027.2, so when skewness is equal to 0, the predicted value of cog is 8027.2. Every 1 unit increase of skewness is associated with an increase of 3029.1 of cog (slope).

- A p value of 7.69e-10 shows that the Intercept estimate is not equal to 0 and therefore statistically significant as the p-value is much smaller than 0.05.

- The multiple R-squared is 0.8836, which means that approximately 88% of the variation in cog is explained by the variation in skewness.

---
# Question 11b: Results
- The plots show the residuals, the density, and theoretical quantities.
The residuals show differences between the actual values of COG and the predicted values obtained from the regression equation

- The density plot shows shape of the distribution by estimating the probability density function of the COG.

- Finally, the QQ-plot shows two datasets plotted against each other. Since the datasets come from the same distribution, the points on the plot roughly form a straight line.

# Question 12: Assumptions

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height = 3, fig.retina = 2, dpi = 300}
##In a new slide, load the assumptions.csv dataset. Make a scatterplot. Explain in a few ##sentences why it would not be appropriate to fit a model to this data.
data_assumptions <- read_csv(file = here("data_raw", "assumptions.csv")) 
   ggplot(data = data_assumptions) + 
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))

```
Comment: It would not be appropriate because the two variables don't seem to be related, they are non-linear data. It is not possible to determine which is the dependent and the independent variable, and the correlation coefficient of -0.06 shows that there is no correlation in the data. This is due to violations in the assumptions for ordinary least squares regression, and more specifically linearity and homoscedasticity.
